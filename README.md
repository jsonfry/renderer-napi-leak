# Renderer NAPI Leak

This is repository to demonstrate resources create with NAPI not being garbage collected when run via a renderer process.

There are a few lines of code in `renderer.js` that get a buffer that's created in C and then do nothing with it. The C code should receive a callback when the JS buffer gets garbage collected, this never happens and therefore the data backing the buffer can never be cleared. The code will keep running until the OS freezes.

However when you move that same code to `main.js` it behaves as you'd expected, the callback in C is called regularly and the code is able to clear the memory backing the buffer.

Here is the [NAPI documentation for creating an external buffer](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v12.x/api/n-api.html#n_api_napi_create_external_buffer). Pay particular attention the `finalize_cb` parameter.

To use:
```
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

This will quickly cause the OS to run out of memory and grind to a halt so don't let it run for long, keep on eye on system memory usage.


# electron-quick-start

**Clone and run for a quick way to see Electron in action.**

This is a minimal Electron application based on the [Quick Start Guide](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start) within the Electron documentation.

**Use this app along with the [Electron API Demos](https://electronjs.org/#get-started) app for API code examples to help you get started.**

A basic Electron application needs just these files:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.

You can learn more about each of these components within the [Quick Start Guide](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start).

## To Use

To clone and run this repository you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start
# Go into the repository
cd electron-quick-start
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Run the app
npm start
```

Note: If you're using Linux Bash for Windows, [see this guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/261575/how-to-run-graphical-linux-desktop-applications-from-windows-10s-bash-shell/) or use `node` from the command prompt.
